# Smart-Chess-Robot
Two Arduino boards are used for this project.  
Arduino Mega (sensor readings and UART communication)  
Arduino Uno (control motors)  
The applescript app connects the commandline Sjeng Chess Engine to the Arduino through serial UART.  
Sjeng provides computer moves and reports invalid moves made by a human player.  
# Supported game modes:
human vs human  
human vs computer (human first)  
computer vs human (computer first)  
computer vs computer
